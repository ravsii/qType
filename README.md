# **qType**

qType (from _Quick Type_) is a ðŸš€ _blazingly fast_ ðŸš€\* terminal-based typing practice tool,
inspired by [keybr] and [monkeytype]. Typing inside the terminal eliminates the
overhead of browsers, providing a smoother, more focused experience without the
disruptions of Web-UI freezes.

Currently, qType is my **Rust-learning project**, but who knowsâ€”maybe one day
it will evolve into something much more.

_\* It's not really "blazingly fast", but since it's a Rust project, this
phrase is a must-include as a meme._
