# **qType**

qType (from _Quick Type_) is a ðŸš€ _blazingly fast_ ðŸš€\* terminal-based typing
practice tool, inspired by [keybr] and [monkeytype]. Typing inside the terminal
eliminates the overhead of browsers, providing a smoother, more focused
experience without the disruptions of Web-UI freezes.

Currently, qType is my **Rust-learning project**, but who knowsâ€”maybe one day
it will evolve into something much more.

_\* It's not really "blazingly fast", but since it's a Rust project, this
phrase is a must-include as a meme._

## Installation

```sh
cargo install qtype
```

## **Why qType?**

- **Minimalist Interface**: A distraction-free environment tailored for
  terminal enthusiasts.
- **Performance**: Leveraging Rust's speed, qType delivers a seamless
  experience with low resource usage.
- **Focus on Typing**: No browser, no fluff â€” just pure typing practice.

## **Demo**

## **Features**

- **Minimalistic UI**: qType only has features it's actually need.
- **Multiple Dictionaries**: Dictionaries of 10k words per language (based on
  usage) of several languages are bundled within the app.
  - We'll remove them from the binary later and make it lazy-loadable.

### **Planned**

- **Custom Dictionaries**: Support for user-defined dictionaries and additional
  languages.
- **Accurate WPM/CPM Calculation**: Improved metrics for better accuracy and
  insights.
- **Comprehensive Stats**: A dedicated stats screen with SQLite integration for
  tracking progress over time.
- **Prettier UI**: A more intuitive terminal interface.
